This guide will help you with all your bot needs. This is my first addon and is a work in progress. Check MCPEDL.com for updates.

So to get started open up a crafting bench and throw these ingredients in it to craft one.\r\nbot_topia.botCrafter.text01=            You can place the §bBot Crafter§r just like any other block in the game.

To turn the bot on feed it a piece of redstone dust. Now that your bot is on you will probably want to give it a job like farming for example. To give your bot a job you will need to use the §bBot Crafter§r to make §bBot Chips§r. Give your bot a §bBot Chip§r to program it to do a job. The next section will cover the differnt types of bot chips and jobs.\r\n\r\n##window chrom title\r\nhowtoplay.botChip.title=Bot-Topia: Bot Chips\r\n\r\n##BUTTON 5\r\nhowtoplay.botChip=Bot Chip\r\n\r\n##bot chips content\r\nbotChip.header.title00=§bBot Chips\r\nbot_topia.botChip.text00=           Bot Chips are how you program your bot to do jobs. All Bot Chips are made using the §bBot Crafter§r. After you turn your bot on with redstone dust you can install a Bot Chip in it. Some chips require different bot upgrades. The guard chip for example requires your bot to have §bBot Legs§r installed before you can install the §bGuard Chip§r.\r\n\r\nbotChip.header.title01=§bBasic Chip\r\nbot_topia.botChip.text01=           The Basic Chip is the base for all of the other Bot Chips. It's the only chip that doesn't interact with the bots, at least not on it's own.  Combine other materials with a Basic Chip to make the different Bot Chips.\r\n\r\nbotChip.header.title02=§bFarm Chip\r\nbot_topia.botChip.text02=Combine an Iron Hoe and a Basic Chip to make a Farm Chip.

Till some dirt and drop some seeds on the ground, or even better open the bots inventory by clicking on the bot and place the crop or seed you want to grow inside it's inventory.

Farm Bots will not plant pumpkins and melons but they will harvest them for you if you plant the seeds.\r\nbot_topia.farmBot.text01=           Farm Bots can do a lot of work but they need help. When a Farm Bot has enough crops it will give them to a §bHarvest Bot§r to be placed into your storage system of choice.

From time to time the Harvest bot will search for a hopper in the ground it can sit on to unload its cargo. Remember these bots can't jump so set an item hopper into the ground so they can roll on top of it. From there just point the hopper into your storage of choice. Give a §bHarvest Chip§r to a bot to make a Harvest Bot.\r\n\r\n##window chrome title\r\nhowtoplay.hopperBot.title=Bot-Topia: Hopper Bot\r\n\r\n##BUTTON 9\r\nhowtoplay.hopperBot=Hopper Bot\r\n\r\n##hopper content\r\nhopperBot.header.title00=§bHopper Bot\r\nbot_topia.hopperBot.text00=         A Hopper Bot will pick up anything that crosses its path.

If you want a Guard Bot to stop following you sneak click on the guard bot to make it sit. The Guard bot will hold it's ground. Guard Bots will attack any nearby enemies, or any mob that attacks them or the player. Guard Bots will also target any mob that you attack. You can drop weapons on the ground and the Guard Bot will pick them up and equip it.  You can give it a sword or a bow. They will upgrade the weapon they are holding if a better one is available for them to pick up. This also works for armor, you just cant see the armor they are wearing.\r\nbot_topia.guardBot.text01=          You can ride Guard Bots into battle no saddle needed. You can control the Guard Bots direction by holding a bow in your hand. While riding a Guard bot you can access its inventory.

They will follow you even if you are not holding redstone or §bredstone flakes§r. Miner bots won't do all the work for you but they will help. They will follow you around collecting blocks dropped from mining and digging up ores. They will place torches down if they are in a dark area. \r\nbot_topia.minerBot.text01=          When riding a Miner bot the controls are the same as riding a horse. Riding a Miner Bot will put it into drill mode. Walk into a wall to drill through it. This is where having more than one is a good idea. One can place torches while the other one is in drill mode. Miner Bots will not mine emeralds, diamonds, or guilded blackstone. This is to prevent them from being dropped into lava. Even though Miner Bots can walk in lava it's not a good idea to ride them through lava.
