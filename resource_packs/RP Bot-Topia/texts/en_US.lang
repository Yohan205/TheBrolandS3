bot_topia.welcome.text00=               Welcome! Bot-Topia is an addon that allows you to build bots, craft parts and add them to your bot. You can even craft Bot Chips to program your bots to do jobs for you. This guide will help you with all your bot needs. This is my first addon and is a work in progress. Check MCPEDL.com for updates. Enjoy!

welcomeTwo.header.title00=§bBots
bot_topia.welcomeTwo.text00=            This is a bot. They can be crafted in a §bBot Crafter§r. Bots Love redstone. They will follow you if you hold redstone dust or §bredstone flakes §rin your hand. §eYou can also Feed them redstone dust or flakes to heal them if they are damaged.§r Feeding them kind of charges them up. They get a little speed boost when they eat. Bots without legs cannot jump so sometimes its easier to use a lead to move them around.
bot_topia.welcomeTwo.text01=You can open the inventory of most bots by interacting with them when you do not have other bot related items in your hand. You can put things into their inventory and take things out. §eFor more information check out the getting started bot section.

bot_topia.botCrafter.text00=            To make things easy all the recipes in this addon can be made using the §bBot Crafter§r and it's the starting point for this addon. The order of the recipes are also an indication of the progression in the bot building process. So to get started open up a crafting bench and throw these ingredients in it to craft one.
bot_topia.botCrafter.text01=            You can place the §bBot Crafter§r just like any other block in the game. But the easiest way to pick it up is sneak clicking on it. It should pop right off the ground for you. It's pretty easy from here but I'll walk you through how to build and use the bots in the next steps.

bot.header.title02=§bTurning on your Bot
bot_topia.bot.text02=           You'll notice that when you first put your bot down it will be off. To turn the bot on feed it a piece of redstone dust. Now that your bot is on you will probably want to give it a job like farming for example. To give your bot a job you will need to use the §bBot Crafter§r to make §bBot Chips§r. Give your bot a §bBot Chip§r to program it to do a job. The next section will cover the differnt types of bot chips and jobs.

The guard chip for example requires your bot to have §bBot Legs§r installed before you can install the §bGuard Chip§r.

botChip.header.title01=§bBasic Chip
bot_topia.botChip.text01=           The Basic Chip is the base for all of the other Bot Chips. It's the only chip that doesn't interact with the bots, at least not on it's own.  Combine other materials with a Basic Chip to make the different Bot Chips.

Till some dirt and drop some seeds on the ground, or even better open the bots inventory by clicking on the bot and place the crop or seed you want to grow inside it's inventory.

bot_topia.farmBot.text01=           Farm Bots can do a lot of work but they need help. When a Farm Bot has enough crops it will give them to a §bHarvest Bot§r to be placed into your storage system of choice. Give a bot a §bFarm Chip§r to make a Farm bot.

From time to time the Harvest bot will search for a hopper in the ground it can sit on to unload its cargo. Remember these bots can't jump so set an item hopper into the ground so they can roll on top of it. From there just point the hopper into your storage of choice.

If you want a Guard Bot to stop following you sneak click on the guard bot to make it sit. The Guard bot will hold it's ground. Guard Bots will attack any nearby enemies, or any mob that attacks them or the player. Guard Bots will also target any mob that you attack. You can drop weapons on the ground and the Guard Bot will pick them up and equip it.  You can give it a sword or a bow. They will upgrade the weapon they are holding if a better one is available for them to pick up. This also works for armor, you just cant see the armor they are wearing.
bot_topia.guardBot.text01=          You can ride Guard Bots into battle no saddle needed. You can control the Guard Bots direction by holding a bow in your hand. While riding a Guard bot you can access its inventory. Give a §bGuard Chip§r to a §bWalker Bot§r to make a Guard bot.

Miner bots won't do all the work for you but they will help. They will follow you around collecting blocks dropped from mining and digging up ores. They will place torches down if they are in a dark area. 
bot_topia.minerBot.text01=          When riding a Miner bot the controls are the same as riding a horse. Riding a Miner Bot will put it into drill mode. Walk into a wall to drill through it. This is where having more than one is a good idea. One can place torches while the other one is in drill mode. Miner Bots will not mine emeralds, diamonds, or guilded blackstone. This is to prevent them from being dropped into lava. Even though Miner Bots can walk in lava it's not a good idea to ride them through lava. Enjoy!
